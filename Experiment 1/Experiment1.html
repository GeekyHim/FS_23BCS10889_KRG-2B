        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>👋 Hi, I'm @GeekyHim, Himanshu Gupta, a Bachelor of Engineering (CSE) student at Chandigarh University.

I am deeply passionate about continuous learning, innovation, and problem-solving. My journey in computer science revolves around exploring emerging technologies, executing impactful projects, and constantly challenging myself to improve. Whether it's working on development projects, participating in hackathons, or collaborating with like-minded individuals, I always strive to push my boundaries and gain meaningful experiences.

Beyond academics, I actively engage in leadership roles, community-driven initiatives, and technical clubs, where I contribute to fostering a culture of learning and collaboration. As the Joint Secretary of C Square Club, I play a key role in organizing workshops, events, and hands-on coding sessions that empower students to grow their technical skills.

I have also had the privilege of participating in various prestigious competitions, where I worked on real-world problem statements, applying my technical expertise to develop innovative solutions. One such competition was NIT Hamirpur Hack 5.0 National Level Hackthon in which me and my team emerged Grand Winners. Additionally, attending workshops such as the Web and Mobile App Development workshop by IIT Roorkee, Data Analysis and SQL Boot camp by NIT Trichy etc. has further expanded my knowledge in software development related fields.

My goal is to continuously evolve, contribute to impactful projects, and collaborate with individuals who share the same enthusiasm for technology and innovation. I am always open to new opportunities, challenges, and learning experiences. </p>
